    """
    Identify and return missing data (start_time and length) for each device (except the phone).

    This function assumes that the smartwatch and two muscleBAN should all acquire data at the same time, four times
    per day. Due to potential connection issues, some acquisitions may be missing. This function determines which
    timestamps are missing for each device, based on what was recorded by the others.

    In the case that all devices failed to acquire in one of these four scheduled acquisitions, this function uses the
    average acquisition times (based on the common acquisition times during the five days of acquisition of the subject),
    to get the missing timestamp.

    Steps:
    (1) Obtain all unique timestamps of all devices, except the phone. As there is always some delay, timestamps that are
        less than ten minute apart are considered to be the same one.

    (2) Compare the start_times in the acquisitions_dict with the unique timestamps to get a list with missing timestamps
        for each device.

    (3) If the length of the actual start times and the missing start times is less than four then there was one scheduled
        acquisition that either did not happen or all devices failed. In this case find the last remaining missing timestamps
        based on the average start times of the entire week.

    (4) For each missing timestamp, a default duration (20-minute acquisition) is appended to the list with lengths in
        the missing data dictionary.

    :param subject_folder_path: Path to the folder containing all data from the subject
    :param acquisitions_dict: A dictionary where keys are device names, and values are dictionaries with two lists:
             - 'length': List of signal lengths.
             - 'start_times': List of corresponding start timestamps.
             Example:
             {
                 "phone": {"start_times": ["11:20:20.000"], "length": [10000]},
                 "watch": {"start_times": ["10:20:50.000", "12:00:00.000"], "length": [500, 950]}
             }
    :param fs: the sampling frequency of the sensors in Hz. Default = 100.
    :param tolerance_seconds: Time in seconds used to consider two start times as referring to the same acquisition.
                            Default = 600. (e.g., 12:00:00 and 12:03:00 are considered to be the same start time).
    :return: A dictionary in the same format as `acquisitions_dict`, but containing only the missing acquisitions
             detected for each device.
